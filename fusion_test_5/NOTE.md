### Notes

This is a fully working app utilizing beta priors. It applies an average first, then beta priors, to the last two mixtures. It also averages slightly all previous readings. It is very similar to fusion_test_6.

**UPDATE**

As of Feb 24, 2017 this app is now depricated in favor of fusion_6. Fusion_5 doesn't implement priors, which significantly speed the data up.
