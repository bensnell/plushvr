Notes on settings

IngrSettings.xml

v1.0 
Used for the majority of testing in the beginning. Optimal sets of easing parameters if fps is really high. Potentially useful on RPI3, but not RPI0 (too slow).

v2.0
Params optimized for RPI0, where fps is 18 and easing must be minimal.
OpFlow params ideal for minimizing "stuck" high values. Higher NPoly and Sigma appear to resolve this.
