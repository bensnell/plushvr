This app works and successfully transmits OSC, but it was experimentally stripped of unnecessary components (anything related to drawing, especially in Ingr), to test performance. As it turns out, there was no change in performance, so the original app fusion_test_3 will be adapted with osc to form fusion_test_5.

This app is no longer useful.
