### Notes

This is a fully-working test using beta priors on the last two mixtures. This differs only from fusion_test_5 in applying priors before averaging and allowing more noise up until the very last average.

This also applies priors to every ingredient, though all may not be used.

This also applies an optional beta weight to the prior to allow for higher betas for high values and faster rates of decay for lower values.
